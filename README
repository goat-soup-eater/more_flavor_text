The current version is 1.2, the first one to be uploaded to github. 

The MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE add-ons are:
 - *otn*, Original Technology Names. For those who want the flavor but not the changes to technology names.
 - *trimmed_down*, Self-explanatory. For those who want to have the new technology names but trimmed-down flavor text.
 - *trimmed_down_otn*, Trimmed Down with Original Technology Names. For those who want trimmed down flavor text and the old technology names.

To install, you should:
 - Enter the folder *1.2*, download the folder *1.2 main*.
 - Create a copy of *Remnants.jar* in a separate folder, to prevent accidental damage to the game.
 - Open Remnants.jar with an archive tool (WinRar, 7-Zip, etc.)
 - Go to *rotp/lang*.
 - Add the folder *fl* and the *languages.txt* file to the archive.
 - Run the game and choose *Flavor* as your language. Done!
